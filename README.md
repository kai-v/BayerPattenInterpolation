# Bayer Pattern Interpolation
##### Demosiacing of Bayer Pattern images in the BGGR battern comparing the results of Bilinear Interpolation and Gradinet Enhanced Interpolation as described in the paper http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee367/reading/Demosaicing_ICASSP04.pdf .
##### Comparing the PSNR of both the algorithms the gradient enhanced interpolation technique performed better.
